      <h1 class="w3-center">About Sari</h1><br>

      <p class="w3-large">My background in clinical social work has shown me that making small changes can have big impacts on peoples’ lives. For me, yoga started as something small, but has become a way of life. I began practicing yoga because someone I care about recommended it to me. I was diagnosed with osteoporosis relatively young and needed a way to stay strong and active without causing any harm to my bones. What I didn't know was that yoga could also help improve my bone health. I decided to become a yoga instructor to bring the benefits of yoga to other people like me. I am passionate about sharing these benefits with people of all ages and abilities. </p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey">Credentials: Yoga Alliance RYT 200 hr, with advanced training in yoga for osteoporosis, certification in yin and restorative yoga.</p>

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey">MSW, LCSW with over 30 years’ experience working with adolescents, adults and geriatric clientele; many having survived trauma at different stages of their lives.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-center"> What clients have to say about Sari</h1><br>
      <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:900px" >
      <p>"Sari is very passionate about teaching Yoga for Osteoporosis, helping her students learn the positions that improve bone health. She is very thorough in her instructions, emphasizing how to correctly perform each position to achieve the maximum benefit and providing adaptations that one can make when needed. She also explains the importance of each position and which part of the skeleton is being impacted. Sari provides a safe environment that encourages her students to practice with confidence. I feel very fortunate to study with her, knowing I am developing a yoga practice that will benefit me for the rest of my life." - Maureen F.</p>

      <h4>Hatha Yoga</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Designed to align and calm your mind, body and spirit. Practiced regularly, it enhances strength, flexibility, and balance. A Hatha yoga practice may be used by anyone as a way to increase fitness, improve health, attain or restore greater balance and connectedness of mind-body-spirit, and develop mental focus and discipline.</p><br>

      <h4>Yin Yoga</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Designed as a slow-paced style of yoga with poses held for longer periods of time. It stretches and targets both the deep connective tissues between the muscles, and the fascia throughout the body. It literally increases circulation in the joints, making them juicy, and helps improve flexibility.</p><br>

      <h4>Restorative Yoga</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Designed as a practice used for slowing down and opening your body through passive stretching. It is the centering of your breath and body. Poses are held for long periods of time. This allows your muscles to relax deeply. Props such as blocks, blankets, and bolsters are used to support your body, helping you to hold poses longer.</p><br>

      <h4>12 Poses for Healthy Bones</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Alignments which create pressure on your bones, making them stronger. Poses are simple. In shivasana (final rest) all you have to do is lie quietly on your mat!</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Researchers found that when done on a regular basis, these simple 12 poses significantly improved bone density. You can read more about it
